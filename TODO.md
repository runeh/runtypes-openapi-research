# todo list

- check if we can do a deep invariant to make sure no refs
- "format" in strings. Probably a type checking function?
- "in64". Can we represent that sensibly?
- include descriptions more places?
- Helper to get "real" type of a schema object
- Handle other types than json
- Handle responses
- Handle oneOf
- Handle anyOf
- use "example" field
- Validator functions for date etc
- Use some specific number type? not just Number?
- get rid og "HttpMethods" from the bleh types package
- Move code into openapi3 file
- Think about how to deal with recursive refs. There was an option in the lib?
